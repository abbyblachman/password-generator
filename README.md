# password-generator

This is a secure password generator. 

I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create this application. 

This application demonstrates the following JavaScript concepts:

- storing variables 
- prompts, confirms, and alerts
- if else logic
- pushing strings to an array 
- for loops 
- transforming arrays to strings 
- updating html using JavaScript 

For CSS, this application uses both Bootstrap and CSS written by me.
